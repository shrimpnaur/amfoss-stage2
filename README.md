**TASK:**

To develop a game using pygame which is similar to the game BREAKOUT where the player control the ball with a paddle and breaks all the bricks to win.

`Have met all the requirements.`



# **GAME MECHANICS:**



# WELCOME TO BRICK BREAKER!!
`Brick Breaker 2.0` is a game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks on the screen. The goal is to clear all the bricks without letting the ball fall. When the player loses, he has 2 more chances and then the game is restarted.


- Press the play button to start the game 
- The player controls a paddle using keyboard to move it horizontally (left key) for left and right key for right
- The ball starts from the middle  to hit the bricks above and then it falls back where the user has to not let it touch the bottom of the screen
- Bricks disappears once the ball touches it
- Speed of the ball is incremented with time as the user hits bricks.
- The game ends if the player breaks all the bricks before using up all 3 lives which makes then win Or if the user fails to hit the ball before it touches the ground 3 times in a row resulting in losing the game.


# IDEA BEHIND IT:

- To start off with this project I thought of making a blueprint about it in my head.
- I initially thought to make this game unique and stand out more than the rest, I should add levels with greater difficulties or more fun elements.
- Also thought to make this Game UI look like one of those old computer games you get for nostalgic purposes haha :)
- I thought of adding music for every part to make the game engaging and I could think of any better music than the one I used (pls play the game ;) )

- Even though I could not add more levels to it as I was running out of time and I wanted to fix the previous part and make it satisfactory, I thought Ill rather do improvements after the submission.


# THE PROCESS:
To make it short, I would say the entire process of creating a whole game in itself was so amusing to me as this was a domain I had never touched before. So it was truly a fun experience. I learn a lot throughout, obviously took help from youtube and AI for modifications but during that process, I learnt a lot about game mechanics.
There were countless videos on youtube to make breakout game and those helped me a lot.
Took blueprint from a video by moscotech.

I also tried to make this a 3 level game, where level 2 would have many balls to deal with and small bricks and level 3 with an amazing speed with lots of lives to make it more thrilling. I should try this soon.

Anyway. I thought of adding a menu classic for games like these. Then added sounds which was my favorite part in this process ;)
Initially I had kept the speed more to make it interesting but that lead to me NEVER winning so decreased it to the level of human capabilities. 

# CONCLUSION:
All in all I would just like to say that, Im up for making more games like these and learning more from all the resources available :)
