TASK: To develop a game using pygame which is similar to brick breaker, almost exactly the same.

I start of with searching about game dev using pygame as I was new to this, so I had to start off with a few introducotry videos, videos about the basics of pygame and truly it was an interesting watch. I got to know that working with pygame is actually really interesting and also it made me work on a completely new domain i.e game dev.

After watching introducotory videos, I searched upon how a good classic brick breaker game looks like, got my videos but i took inpo and ideas from 3 videos mainly
1.
2.
3.
The first video was the one which i used as my blueprint and made this game, learnt about every class, its logic and implementation and tried making other classes, even though got many errors (MANY.) I tried, fixing and tying but yeah got there. Took help from AI to modify it a little bit so that I could add my own touch to the game.

Then came thee idea of adding more levels, thought it was hard in the beginning but again youtube was my rescure. found video no. 2 for level2 adn proceede
then level 3 i had to keep the code simple so i just played with the speed from the begninin code

In the end, added pictures and sound effects to my entire code.
